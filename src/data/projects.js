Explored TFRecord precompute for >7 it/s on M1 GPU, but stayed with optimized PyTorch path for simplicity.\n\nModel: Dual‑encoder with a GIN graph encoder (PyTorch Geometric) and a ChemBERTa SMILES encoder (Hugging Face). Projection heads map to a shared embedding space. InfoNCE contrastive loss aligns modalities (same molecule close; different far).\n\nTraining: Pre‑trained on 500k PubChem samples for 5 epochs on a Kaggle P100, ~7.2–7.3 it/s; robust checkpointing for best/final models.",
